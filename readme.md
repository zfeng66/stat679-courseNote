This repository is about *stat679* course notes and *git practice* assignment.

## course notes

`git-notes.md` records *stat679* course notes.

## collaboration with Sam

`collaboration.md` records some information about my collaboration with Sam. We made an divergence on the **fourth** line and then I resolved that problem.

## create two new branches

Sam and I create two new branches `sed` and `count` respectively.

## countGitInNotes.sh

This file counts the number of word "git" in `git-notes.md` file (in a new branch `count`).

This file is an example about `sed` (in a new branch `sed`).

## merge two branches into master

Finally, we merge `count` and `sed` into `master` branch.
